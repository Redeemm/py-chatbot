"This course focuses on the fundamentals of computer algorithms, emphasizing methods useful in practice. Using the big-O notation, algorithms are classified by their efficiency. We look into basic algorithm strategies and approaches to problem solving. Some of these approaches include the divide and conquer method, dynamic programming, and greedy programming paradigms. Sorting and searching algorithms are discussed in detail as they form part of a solution to a large number of problems solved using computers. The course also provides an introduction to the graph theory and graph algorithms as they are also used in many computer-based applications today."
